* step3: start Docker container:
  docker run
  -d
  --name YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_HERE
  -p YOUR_LOCALHOST_PORT_HERE:27017
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE
  -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  mongo
* step4: Check that the containerâ€™s up and running:
  docker container ls (you should see your container listed).
* step5: Connect to the container and access your MongoDB instance: docker exec -it YOUR_CONTAINER_NAME_HERE bash
* step6: Access the MongoDB instance via the mongo command line interface:
  mongo --username YOUR_USERNAME_HERE --password YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE
  -step 7: Connecting to the database from outside of the container: (mongodb://YOUR_USERNAME_HERE:YOUR_PASSWORD_HERE@0.0.0.0:YOUR_LOCALHOST_PORT_HERE/)
